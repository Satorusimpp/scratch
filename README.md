#ATTENDANCE CHECKER APP

# Problem nowadays
Being a student of ITER,a private college having 75% mandatory attendance criteria is a headache for both the proffs as well as the students.The subject teachers at the start of their respective period are bound to record the student's attendance by roll-calls which is a waste of time and energy.Other major problems such as proxies by students also arise.

#Solution
A app named attendance checker,designed to be efficient and time-saving which is required to be installed by every student of the college.At the time of attendance
the student is required to open the app with the help of user authentication like fingerprints,the permission for accessing location is granted.The app marks the student as present for the particular subject on particular time by matching the classroom's range and student's geo-location.If the student doesnt fall in the required location range of assigned classroom,he/she is automatically marked absent. This completely removes proxy issues and other malpractices to occur for attendance procedures.

#Decision making on basis of Big Data Analysis

The app needs minimum storage and safeguards privacy of user.Every institution across the country can record attendance of their students in  an efficient and hastle-free way.This saves study time and completely removes proxy related problems.
